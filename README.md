My Web Experience and Frontend GoalsI regularly use YouTube and Discord, with YouTube standing out as particularly well-designed. Its ease of navigation allows me to find videos, playlists, and channels effortlessly through a clean search bar and intuitive sidebar. The bright color scheme—vibrant reds, whites, and subtle grays—keeps the interface energetic yet readable, reducing eye strain during long sessions. The overall structure is logical: the homepage prioritizes personalized recommendations, video pages centralize playback with related content below, and the subscription feed organizes updates chronologically. These elements create a seamless, user-focused experience that keeps me engaged.By the end of this cohort, I hope to build the front-end page of a finance webapp that accepts payments in Naira and foreign currencies. The interface will feature a clean currency selector, real-time exchange display, and secure payment forms tailored to local and international users.I’m most excited to deepen my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and React—three pillars of modern frontend development. HTML for semantic structure, CSS for responsive and aesthetic styling, and React for building dynamic, component-based interfaces. What makes me slightly nervous is React’s complexity with state management and hooks, but with consistent practice and dedication, I’m confident I’ll master all three and create polished, interactive web experiences

# Week 1: Website Inspection with DevTools

I inspected **3 websites** using Chrome DevTools (right-click → Inspect):

### 1. Bank Website
- HTML starts with `<html>` and ends with `</html>`
- All content is inside `<body>`
- Many `<script>` links load JavaScript

### 2. Glovo (Food App)
- Found **developer comments** like `<!-- Snackbar container -->`
- Helps explain the code!

### 3. MTN (Telecom)
- Lots of scripts and comments
- Hidden **chatbox** in the `<body>` — only shows when clicked
